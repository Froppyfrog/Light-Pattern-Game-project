## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [https://www.theodinproject.com/ https://www.freecodecamp.org/ https://devdocs.io/]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [While I was working on this project, I continually made small silly mistakes like adding a bracket in the
    wrong spot or adding an extra parenthesis in a function. For example, when I was testing out my button
    game to see if it worked, I noticed the light green button was not changing color when clicked. I spent 
    around half an hour looking at my css code trying to figure out why it was not working. Turns out I had 
    an extra curly bracket inside the #button1.lit section. I also struggled a bit with the javascript portion of 
    the project as I am not as familiar with the topic as I am with html and css. Because of this problem I 
    decided to use some online resources to try and help me understand the code better. With the help of 
    devdocs.io I was able to read up on many of the elements I did not know or understand. I also used
    theodinproject.com and freecodecamp.org to refresh myself on some of the html and css elements that 
    Overall, this was a very good experience to have and I have a very good time putting this project together.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [What is the industry like for a new web developer?
    What would the expectations be for someone like me who is new to the industry and how would I be assisted in meeting those expectations?
    What other skills will I be able to learn on my journey through web development?
    What are some problems that web developers face within the industry?
    What are some success stories like from people within the industry?
    What technologies could I expect to work with while working within the industry?
    What kind of people can I expect to work with and how would our roles be split up?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had more time, I would have added more buttons to try and make the sequence harder to follow. I 
    would have also tried to figure out how to make the sequence randomize at the start of every game 
    every. I also would have tried to style the game’s webpage a bit more because I think it looks a bit bland. 
    Style it and add more colors and effects to really make the project pop and look more attractive to 
    people not familiar with the project. I would have also added a buzzer sound to the game that would play if you guessed the button sequence wrong.]
